Care for You is a comprehensive platform built using the MERN stack, aimed at improving the quality of healthcare services by providing a platform for users to rate and review different wards in healthcare facilities. The project provides an intuitive user interface where users can easily navigate to find the ward they want to rate, and leave a rating on a scale of 1-5 and a comment on their experience. In addition, the platform includes a feature for users to like or dislike reviews left by other users.  

The project is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. MongoDB is used to store all the data related to wards, users, ratings, and reviews. Express is used as the backend framework to handle server-side requests and provide APIs to the frontend. React is used for the frontend to provide an intuitive user interface and interactive features. Node.js is used as the runtime environment to run the server-side code. 

The main goal of Care for You is to provide a platform for users to share their experiences and provide feedback on healthcare facilities. The platform aims to improve the quality of healthcare services by allowing users to rate and review different wards in healthcare facilities. The project also aims to promote transparency and accountability in the healthcare sector by providing a platform for users to share their experiences openly.
